Amstelhaege
###########

This project is based on a case part of the course Heuristics given at the University of Amsterdam. The objective is to find the highest value for a specific area named: 'Amstelhaege'. The Amstelhaege is filled with houses and the score is the sum of these houses. Using multiple alghoritms the score is calculated.  


Prerequisites
