Amstelhaege
###########

This project is based on a case part of the course heuristics given on the University of Amsterdam. The objective is to find the highest value for a specific area named: 'Amstelhaege'. The Amstelhaege is filled with houses and the score is the sum of these houses. Using multiple alghoritms the score is calculated.  

Getting Started
===============

In order to get the code running some addictional requirements need to be met. The installation of these elements described in 'prerequisites' are needed to properly run the code.

Prerequisites
=============

Python:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

Pip:
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Numpy:
    Numpy can be installed using pip install numpy. Numpy is used for its mathematical features
```
pip install numpy
```
    
Matplotlib:
    Matplotlib can be installed using pip install matplotlib. Matplotlib is used to visualize the map
```
pip install matplotlib
```

Running the tests
=================

Go to the map 'run me' chose one of the alghoritms listed in this map and type in a terminal for example:

```
python hill_climber.py
```

Results
=======

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

Deployment
==========

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
