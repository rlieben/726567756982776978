Amstelhaege
###########

This project is based on a case part of the course heuristics given on the University of Amsterdam. The objective is to find the highest value for a specific area named: 'Amstelhaege'. The Amstelhaege is filled with houses and the score is the sum of these houses. Using multiple alghoritms the score is calculated.  

Getting Started
===============

In order to get the code running some addictional requirements need to be met. The installation of these elements described in 'prerequisites' are needed to properly run the code.

Prerequisites
=============
Python:
```
version 3.6.3
```

Numpy:
    Numpy is used for its mathematical features line numpy.random
```
version 1.14
```
    
Matplotlib:
    Matplotlib is used to visualize the map including houses created with rectangles
```
version 2.1.0
```

Running the tests
=================

Go to the map 'run me' chose one of the alghoritms listed in this map and type in a terminal for example:

```
python hill_climber.py
```

Results
=======

Explain what these tests test and why
